Web: Stranger Code -WriteUp-
Author: Andronikos Giachanatzis 

Extract the files from the zip.
Open html file and js
The html file requires a string in the password field
Js file simply takes the input from the passwd field and checks if it's the same with var c
Simply edit the js code to override the check:

    c = strrev(c);

    b = "Congratulation! The flag is: " + flag()

    document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = b
    

The above code replaces the final lines of the original js file.
Instead of checking whether a == c, simply return the flag in b
save js
open html page in a browser again, press check and voila!
