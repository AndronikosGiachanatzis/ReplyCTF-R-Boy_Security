Challenge: Malware in a bottle / Binary
Author: Dimitris Iosifidis

• We see that the file (Malware in a Bottle.bin), is a python file and also is executable.
• If we do string the file we see a clearer image from the file and we see that it has some python files.
• The next step is to run it with chmod.When we run it we see that it goes us to a bot.
• The next step is to find how we are gonna read the python-program that bot runs.
• With the uncompyle6 we can reverse it from .pyc to .py file.
• Now we clearly can see the code of the bot and we see that it has something that decrypt, so
  the only think we do is to print the decrypt text.
